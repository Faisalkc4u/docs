title: "List Team Members"
openapi: "GET /api/v2/admin/team-members/{tenantId}"
---

## Overview

Retrieve all team members for a specific tenant (organization). This endpoint returns paginated results with member details including their role and activity status.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must be a member of the specified tenant

## Security

Users from different tenants will receive empty results (not a 403 error). This ensures tenant isolation while maintaining a consistent API experience.

## Response Details

The response includes:
- User basic information (id, name, email)
- Role within the tenant (ADMIN or MEMBER)
- Activity status (is_active)
- Last activity timestamp

## Performance

This endpoint uses an optimized single JOIN query instead of N+1 queries for better performance with large teams.

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/team-members/1 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

```javascript
const response = await axios.get(
  `/api/v2/admin/team-members/${tenantId}`,
  {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
  }
);
```
