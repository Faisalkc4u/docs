## Overview

Add a new or existing user to a tenant. If the user doesn't exist, a new account will be created automatically.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must have ADMIN role in the specified tenant

## Behavior

- If the email doesn't exist in the system, creates a new user account
- If the user exists, adds them to the tenant with the specified role
- Sets `is_active` to true and updates `last_active_at`
- Fires a `UserRegistered` event for webhook integrations

## Validation Rules

- `email`: Required, must be a valid email format
- `role`: Required, must be either "ADMIN" or "MEMBER"

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/team-members/1 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "role": "MEMBER"
  }'
```

```javascript
await axios.post(
  `/api/v2/admin/team-members/${tenantId}`,
  {
    email: 'newuser@example.com',
