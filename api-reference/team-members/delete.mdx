title: "Remove Team Member"
openapi: "DELETE /api/v2/admin/team-members/{tenantId}/{userId}"
---

## Overview

Remove a user from a tenant. This only removes the user's association with the tenant - the user account itself is not deleted and they can still be members of other tenants.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must have ADMIN role in the specified tenant

## Behavior

- Removes the user-tenant relationship (deletes the pivot record)
- User account remains active in the system
- User can still access other tenants they belong to
- Does not affect the user's data in other tenants

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/team-members/1/5 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

```javascript
await axios.delete(
  `/api/v2/admin/team-members/${tenantId}/${userId}`,
  {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
  }
);
```

## Error Responses

### User Not Found (404)
```json
{
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

### Not a Member (400)
```json
{
  "error": "User is not a member of this Organization"
}
```

## Important Notes

- Removing a user does not delete their account
- The user can be re-added to the tenant later
- Consider implementing a "leave tenant" endpoint for self-service removal
