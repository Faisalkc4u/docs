title: "Get My Orders"
openapi: "GET /api/v2/admin/orders/my-orders"
---

## Overview

Retrieve a paginated list of orders placed by the authenticated user within the specified tenant. This endpoint is useful for customer-facing applications where users need to view their order history.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must be a member of the tenant
- Requires X-Tenant-ID header

## Tenant Scoping

Only orders that match both conditions are returned:
- Orders belonging to the authenticated user
- Orders belonging to the specified tenant

This ensures users can only see their own orders within the current tenant context.

## Response

Returns a paginated list of the user's orders with:
- Order items
- Product details for each item
- Order status and timestamps

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/orders/my-orders \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Tenant-ID: 123'
```

```javascript
const response = await axios.get('/api/v2/admin/orders/my-orders', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    'X-Tenant-ID': tenantId
  }
});

console.log(response.data);
```
