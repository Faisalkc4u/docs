## Overview

Create a new product category in your tenant's catalog. Categories help organize products and improve navigation.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must be a member of the tenant
- Requires X-Tenant-ID header

## Tenant Scoping

Categories are automatically associated with the tenant from the X-Tenant-ID header.

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/category/create \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Tenant-ID: 123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Electronics",
    "description": "Electronic devices and accessories"
  }'
```

```javascript
await axios.post(
  '/api/v2/admin/category/create',
  {
    name: 'Electronics',
    description: 'Electronic devices and accessories'
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      'X-Tenant-ID': tenantId
    }
  }
);
```
