title: "Get Product"
openapi: "GET /api/v2/admin/products/{id}"
---

## Overview

Retrieve detailed information about a specific product by ID. The product must belong to the tenant specified in the X-Tenant-ID header.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must be a member of the tenant
- Requires X-Tenant-ID header

## Tenant Isolation

Products are automatically filtered by tenant. If you request a product that belongs to a different tenant, you'll receive a 404 error.

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/products/42 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Tenant-ID: 123'
```

```javascript
const response = await axios.get(
  `/api/v2/admin/products/${productId}`,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      'X-Tenant-ID': tenantId
    }
  }
);
```
