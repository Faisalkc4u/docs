title: "Create Product"
openapi: "POST /api/v2/admin/products"
---

## Overview

Create a new product in your tenant's catalog. Products are automatically scoped to the tenant specified in the X-Tenant-ID header.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must be a member of the tenant
- Requires X-Tenant-ID header

## Tenant Scoping

Products are automatically associated with the tenant from the X-Tenant-ID header. You don't need to manually set the tenant_id in the request body.

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/products \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'X-Tenant-ID: 123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Coffee Beans",
    "description": "Organic arabica coffee beans",
    "price": 24.99,
    "stock": 100,
    "category_id": 5
  }'
```

```javascript
await axios.post(
  '/api/v2/admin/products',
  {
    name: 'Premium Coffee Beans',
    description: 'Organic arabica coffee beans',
    price: 24.99,
    stock: 100,
    category_id: 5
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      'X-Tenant-ID': tenantId
    }
  }
);
```
