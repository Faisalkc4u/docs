openapi: "DELETE /api/v2/admin/tenants/{id}"

## Overview

Delete a tenant (organization). This uses soft deletes, so the tenant can be recovered if needed.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must have ADMIN role in the tenant

## Soft Deletes

Tenants are soft-deleted, meaning:
- The tenant is marked as deleted but not removed from the database
- Associated data is preserved
- The tenant can be restored if needed
- Deleted tenants don't appear in normal queries

## Important Considerations

Before deleting a tenant:
- Ensure all team members are notified
- Export any important data
- Consider archiving instead of deleting
- Review associated products, orders, and customers

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/tenants/123 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

```javascript
await axios.delete(
  `/api/v2/admin/tenants/${tenantId}`,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  }
);
```
