## Overview

Create a new tenant (organization). The authenticated user will automatically be added as an ADMIN of the new tenant.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token

## Automatic Admin Assignment

When you create a tenant, you are automatically assigned as an ADMIN, giving you full control over the organization.

## Example Usage

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae/api/v2/admin/tenants \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "My New Store"
  }'
```

```javascript
await axios.post(
  '/api/v2/admin/tenants',
  {
    name: 'My New Store'
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  }
);
```

## Next Steps

After creating a tenant:
1. Add team members using the team member endpoints
2. Create categories for your products
3. Add products to your catalog
4. Configure webhooks for integrations
