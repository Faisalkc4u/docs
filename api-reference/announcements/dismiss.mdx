## Notes

- This endpoint creates or updates an `announcement_reads` record for the current user
- Sets the `dismissed` flag to `true` and `dismissed_at` timestamp to the current time
- Dismissed announcements will not appear in the `/active` endpoint results
- If the announcement is already dismissed, the operation is idempotent
- Only announcements belonging to the specified tenant can be dismissed
- Dismissing an announcement also automatically marks it as read
