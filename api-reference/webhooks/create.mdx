## Overview

Subscribe to webhook events for your tenant. When events occur, the system will send HTTP POST requests to your specified URL.

## Authorization

- User must be authenticated with a valid Bearer token
- User must have ADMIN role in the tenant

## Webhook Delivery

- Events are delivered via HTTP POST to your URL
- Includes event type and payload
- Retries on failure with exponential backoff
- Delivery status tracked in webhook_deliveries table

## Security

- Use HTTPS URLs for webhook endpoints
- Verify webhook signatures to ensure authenticity
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate deliveries
