## Welcome to Urban Things API

Urban Things provides a comprehensive multi-tenant e-commerce platform API built with Laravel 11. This API enables you to manage products, categories, orders, team members, and more across multiple organizations.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - Users can belong to multiple organizations
- **Role-Based Access Control** - ADMIN and MEMBER roles per tenant
- **Team Member Management** - Add, update, and remove team members
- **Product & Category Management** - Full CRUD operations
- **Order Processing** - Complete order management system
- **Event-Driven** - Webhook integrations and event publishing
- **Secure Authentication** - Laravel Sanctum token-based auth

## Base URL

```
Production: https://faisalshop.mvp-apps.ae
Development: http://localhost:3000
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens (Laravel Sanctum).

### Getting a Token

First, authenticate to receive a token:

```bash
POST /api/v2/admin/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

### Using the Token

Include the token in the Authorization header for all subsequent requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {your-token}
```

## Multi-Tenancy

Most endpoints require a tenant context. Include the tenant ID in the header:

```bash
X-Tenant-ID: 123
```

This ensures data isolation and proper access control across different organizations.

## API Versioning

The API uses URL-based versioning:

- **v1**: Public consumer-facing endpoints (`/api/v1/...`)
- **v2**: Admin and management endpoints (`/api/v2/admin/...`)

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage and system stability. If you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Response Format

All responses follow a consistent JSON format:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "message": "Success message"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

### Validation Error
```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "field_name": ["Error message"]
  }
}
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following parameters:

- `page` - Page number (default: 1)
- `per_page` - Items per page (default: 15)

Paginated responses include:
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "current_page": 1,
  "per_page": 15,
  "total": 100,
  "last_page": 7
}
```

## Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found
- `422` - Validation Error
- `429` - Too Many Requests
- `500` - Server Error
